## Scenario
You are part of the marketing department or a Marketing Agency with the goal of optimizing target audience selection. Given a limited budget, your task is to assist marketing specialists in identifying key individuals for targeted outreach.

## Tasks
1. **Create a Directed Graph:**
   - Utilize the provided data file, `connections.txt`, to construct a directed graph representing relationships between individuals.

2. **Identify Bridge Nodes:**
   - Determine and display the nodes that act as bridges in the network.

3. **Graph Density:**
   - Calculate and present the density of the graph. Provide insights based on your observations.

4. **Node Connectivity:**
   - Highlight nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections.

5. **In/Out Connections:**
   - Identify nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.

6. **Centrality Measures:**
   - Calculate and visualize nodes with the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality. Interpret your findings.

7. **Community Detection:**
   - Implement a community detection algorithm on the directed graph and display the number of communities formed.

8. **Largest and Smallest Community:**
   - Showcase the largest and smallest communities detected. Provide interpretations based on your analysis.

9. **Top Three Communities Visualization:**
   - Draw the three largest communities. Remove the top 3 nodes with the highest Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Eigenvector for each community in separate plots.

10. **Influencers of Top Three Communities:**
    - Identify and visualize influencers within the top three communities.

11. **Action Plan:**
    - a. Define a hypothetical business context (e.g., telecom, marketing agency).
    - b. Specify a hypothetical marketing budget.
    - c. Determine a hypothetical cost per action (advertisement cost).
    - d. Develop a strategy on whom to target based on the analysis conducted.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., NetworkX, Matplotlib).
- Execute the provided script or run the code in a Jupyter notebook.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions to perform the analysis tasks.

## Conclusion
The Social Network Analysis Homework provides valuable insights into the network structure, identifies key nodes and influencers, and assists in making informed decisions for targeted marketing efforts within a constrained budget. The action plan guides the implementation of these findings in a practical business scenario.
